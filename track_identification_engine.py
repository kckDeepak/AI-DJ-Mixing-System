# track_identification_engine.py
"""
This module implements a track identification engine that processes user input to generate a structured setlist
for events, leveraging the Google Gemini AI model. It scans a local directory for MP3 files, parses user preferences
(including time segments, genres, and specific song requests), and generates an unordered pool of available tracks
that match the criteria. The output is saved as a JSON file for further use.

Key features:
- Scans local MP3 files and extracts metadata (artist and title).
- Uses Gemini AI to interpret user input and select appropriate tracks.
- Handles unavailable songs by logging them separately.
- Ensures track selections approximate the desired time duration (assuming 3-4 minutes per track).

Dependencies:
- google-generativeai: For interacting with the Gemini API.
- python-dotenv: For loading environment variables.
- Standard library: json, datetime, random, os, re.
